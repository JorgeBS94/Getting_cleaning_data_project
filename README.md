# Getting_cleaning_data_project

Throughout this project, we have obtained and cleaned data from accelerometers from a Samsung Galaxy S device. The goal is to provide a tidy dataset that can be further analysed. This repository contains all the files employed, which are the following:

**run_analysis.R** : this file contains the main steps used to download and transform the data up to the obtention of a tidy dataset. 


**CodeBook.Rmd**: it describes the variables, the data and every transformation we performed in order to clean up the data.


**tidy_data.txt**: it is a text file containing the tidy dataset generated as an output of the "run_analysis.R" file.
